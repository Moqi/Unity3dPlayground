**Unity3D Playground**

This is just my little test project for playing around with [Unity3D](http://unity3d.com/).

Note to self (Resources I used while learning Unity - might come in handy later):
- [Great intro videoes (watched them all - cool stuff)](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/37093-Over-7-hours-of-Unity-Training-Videos-Download-them-now!) 
- [Setup Git with Unity3D](http://www.chrisdanielson.com/2011/06/04/unity3d-projects-version-control-git/)
- [Other great video tutorials] (http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11F87EB39F84E292&feature=plcp)
